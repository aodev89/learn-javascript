// Variables
/* Variables are values in your code that can represent diffent values */

firstname = "maaike";
x = 2;

console.log(firstname, x);

// If you wanna change the value you simple do so and the output will change

// Declaring variables

// When you first wanna create a variables you declare it first. Here we will take a look at let, var, const

let firstName = "maria";
firstName = "silje";

console.log(firstName);

// let and var are both used for variables that might have a new value assigned to them.
/* The difference between var and let is that it is related to scopes. var has global scope and let has block scope. var global scopes means that you can use the variables defined with var in the entire script. let block spcoes means you can only use variables defined with let in the spesific block of code. const on the other hand is used for variables that only get a value assignesd once. feks the value of pi. */

const someNumber = 3;
someNumber = 2;

// this will output an error

// Now you know about variables.
// Next step: Primitive data types
